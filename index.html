          <h1 class="thin-headline">Why teach kids to code?</h1>
          <p>Learning to code is part of the process of future proofing our children. In the coming years jobs will require more technical knowledge, and jobs in the areas of I.T. and programming will expand greatly.</p>
          <h1 class="thin-headline space">Wouldn't it be expensive for schools to teach code?</h1>
          <p>Programming doesn't typically require any special software or hardware. Any school with a computer lab can be retrofitted easily to teach kids how to code. The developer culture also includes many open-source (free) tools to help beginners get started, and many professional developers swear by free-to-use software (libraries) like Ruby on Rails and jQuery.</p>

Software developers are the highest estimated increase, at around a 32% increase in the next 7-8 years. Kids educated in these fields will have more jobs available to them.</p>

                <p>Currently in the industry the predominant gender is overwhelmingly male. By introducing code at younger ages in school, girls that enjoy code will get the chance to try it before it becomes seen as a male dominated field in the later years of school. I think implementing this would quickly begin decreasing the gender gap.</p>

            <h1 class="thin-headline">A 12 year-old app developer</h1>
            <p>At 12 years old, Thomas Suarez has already worked with programming languages such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>.</p>
            <p>At the time of his <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/thomas_suarez_a_12_year_old_app_developer.html" target="_blank">TED talk</a> he had already published two applications in the app store and begun helping students in his school to learn how to build apps. If anyone is a testemant to how far kids can go in programming, Thomas is a shining example.</p>
            <p>"I’ve started an app club at school… any student at my school can come and learn how to design an app. This allows me to share my experience with others."</p>

            <h2>Learning Difficulties</h2>
            <p>Thomas talks about his experience in learning how to code, “For soccer, you can join a soccer team. For violin you can get lessons. But where do you go if you want to learn how to make an app? Not many parents have made an app before." He expresses frustration with not having a way to learn how to code in school. "A lot of kids these days like to play games, but now they want to make them." Without proper education and opportunities in school though it becomes really difficult for students to learn how to code.</p>

            <p>Today, Thomas is 14 years old. He has been given the chance to test advanced technologies like <a href="https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCsQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fglass%2Fstart%2F&ei=jiWcUrumCobfoASb54HABQ&usg=AFQjCNE_1rxbVEu695SrYg52nMIjyaitUw&bvm=bv.57155469,d.cGU">Google Glass</a>.</p>

            <h1 class="thin-headline">Teaching 4th graders to develop games</h1>
            <p>The students of Aspen Creek’s 4th grade class are living proof that kids can begin learning this stuff this young. Using the software <a href="http://www.agentsheets.com/">Agentsheets</a> fourth-graders are learning to design and build their own video games. In the Youtube video “<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FSbA_YMsNE#t=85">Frogger Helps Teach Kids Computer Science</a>” Brian Geraghty, 4th Grade Teacher, explains how the kids had so much fun creating their own “Packman” and “Frogger” games. He makes the remark that the students picked up more in half a day than he did in the three day seminar that he attended on the software.</p>
            <p>The Agentseets software focuses on teaching kids computational thinking. Rather than writing code directly with text, it allows the user to create “rules”, similar to functions and parameters passed in code, to allow users to create programs. In the video the kids work on their games independently and help each other solve problems as they encounter them, similarly to how students work in high school or even post-secondary computer science programs.</p>
